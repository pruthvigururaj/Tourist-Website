            <p>Mysore's history centers on the powerful Wodeyar dynasty (1399-1947), initially vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, who built a prosperous kingdom known for its rich culture, grand palaces (like the iconic Mysore Palace), and significant contributions to arts and administration, especially under rulers like Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV; the kingdom also famously clashed with the British East India Company in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, culminating in Tipu Sultan's death and Mysore becoming a princely state under British rule before joining India, leaving behind a legacy of Indo-Saracenic architecture and vibrant festivals like Dasara. </p>
             <p>There is an inscription in Mysuru by the Hoysalas that dates back to the 11th and 12th century. The Mysuru was ruled by Gangas, Chalukyas, Cholas and Hoysalas. After the Hoysalas came, the Vijayanagar Kings and then the Mysuru Yadu dynasty came to power in 1399A.D.</p>
